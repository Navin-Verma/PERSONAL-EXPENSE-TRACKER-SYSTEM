* Users can:
  * Add expenses
  * Edit expenses
  * Delete expenses
  * View saved expenses
* Data is stored in:
  * CSV file
  * OR JSON file

## Project Goal

* Practice building a real-world Python application
* Apply concepts like:
  * File handling
  * Functions
  * Object-Oriented Programming
* Can be developed as:
  * Command Line Interface (CLI) application
  * OR GUI application using Tkinter

## Features

* Add new expense
  * Input: Date, Category, Amount, Description

* Edit existing expense
  * Select expense by ID or index
  * Update details

* Delete expense
  * Select expense by ID or index
  * Remove from file

* Category management
  * Predefined categories (Food, Bills, Travel, etc.)
  * Option to add new category

* Monthly summary
  * Calculate total spending for selected month
  * Show category-wise spending

  * Add Expense
  * Edit Expense
  * Delete Expense
  * View Expenses
  * Monthly Summary
  * Exit
* Perform selected operation
* Save changes automatically to file

## What I Learned

* Reading and writing CSV files
* Reading and writing JSON files
* Creating structured programs
* Using classes and objects
* Building a functional CLI/GUI application

## Declaration
This project was built as part of the Cryptonic Area Virtual Python Internship Program. It showcases the practical application of Python concepts and hands-on experience gained during the internship.
